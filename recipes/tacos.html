        <h4>What is Birria?</h4>

            <p>Birria, aka tacos de birria, is a Mexican dish of meat (usually goat or beef) stewed in its 
                braising liquid until it reaches a melt-in-your-mouth texture. Traditionally, it gets its 
                flavor from dried chile peppers. Birria can be served alone as a stew or on corn tortillas.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients Overview</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Dried chile peppers:</strong> The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo 
                chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chilles. For a bit of extra heat, don't 
                remove the seeds.</li>

            <li><strong>Beef:</strong> Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're 
                done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>

            <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, 
                cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.</li>

            <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.</li>

            <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other ingredients 
                to unlock extra layers of flavor.</li>

            <li><strong>Vinegar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the 
                braising liquid.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Tortillas:</strong> Use store-bought or home-made corn tortillas.</li>

            <li><strong>Onion and Cilantro:</strong> Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro
                for a final punch of flavor and texture.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Sauce Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>6 dried guajillo chile peppers, seeded</li>

            </ul>

        <h4>Meat Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>4 pounds beef chuck roast</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Tacos Ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>18 corn tortillas</li>
                <li>1 large white onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded queso asadero (white Mexican cheese) (Optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fill a pot with 
                    water and bring to a boil</li>

                <li>Start the sauce: Add gaujillo, arbol, and acho chile peppers to the boiling water; boil 
                    for 5 minutes.</li>
                
                <li>Remove pot from the heat and allow peppers to soak until cool. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of 
                    the cooking water.</li>
                
                <li>Meanwhile, sear the meat: Rinse beef and pat dry with paper towels. Cut beef into chunks 
                    if desired, and season with salt and pepper.</li>

                <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook until browned on all 
                    sides, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>

                <li>While the beef is searing, continue the sauce: Line a heavy cast-iron grill pan or griddle 
                    with aluminum foil and place over high heat. Arrange tomatoes in a single layer on top. 
                    Grill until tomato skin is burned on all sides and begins to peel, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>

                <li>Place cool chile peppers in to a blender. Add grilled tomatoes, vinegar, garlic, 2 teaspoons 
                    black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, oregano, and salt in a blender. Pour 
                    in the reserved 1/4 cup of chile water and blend until smooth.</li>

                <li>Strain chile sauce through a mesh strainer and pour over browned meat in the Dutch oven, 
                    turning roast so it is completely covered with sauce; cover with a lid.</li>

                <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting meat every 45 minutes with sauce, until birria begins to 
                    fall apart, 3 to 4 hours. Remove the lid and bake, uncovered, until birria is crispy on top, 
                    about 20 minutes. Remove from oven, cover with 2 layers of aluminum foil, and allow to rest 
                    in a warm area for 10 minutes.</li>

                <li>Remove meat to a cutting board and strain off any fat from the sauce. Shred meat with two 
                    forks, then return meat to the pot and stir with the sauce to combine.</li>

                <li>Assemble and heat tacos: Fill each tortilla with birria and top with Mexican cheese, chopped 
                    onion, and cilantro. Warm tortillas on a griddle, flipping until both sides are crispy and 
                    cheese is melted.</li>

                <li>Serve with extra sauce on the side for dipping.</li>
            </ol>
