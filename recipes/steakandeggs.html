        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Steak and eggs is a classic American breakfast dish of fried eggs and beefsteak. It's often served with potatoes, toast, 
                or hash browns. It can be made with a variety of side condiments like ketchup, hot sauce, salsa, and/or avacado. Flavor can also
                be added with herbs such as parsley, basil, or chives.</p>


        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Steak</li>
            <li>Salt & Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Olive Oil, Avacado Oil, or Butter</li>
            <li>Fresh Parsley (optional)</li>
            <li>Avacado (optional)</li>
            <li>Whole Grain Bread (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            
            <li><strong>Dry and season the steak.</strong>Pat dry with paper towels. Add a small amount of melted butter or oil spread on to both
                 sides. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper. </li>

            <li><strong>Cook the steak.</strong> Refer to a time chart for appropiate steak cook-time with regards to thickness and method (using a 
                grill or stovetop). Let the steak rest on a cutting board while moving on to Step 3</li>

            <li><strong>Cook the eggs.</strong> Cook using the desired method for eggs. While we prefer/recommend them "sunny side up", any method,
                 such as scrambled may be utilized and enjoyed for this recipe. </li>

            <li><strong>Serve the steak and eggs together.</strong> If you're adding hash browns, we recommended cooking them before the steak and 
                let them sit in a covered container. If toast, we recommend toasting while cooking the eggs (during or just prior to Step 3). If adding
                 avacado, we recommend pre-slicing or doing so while the eggs or steak is cooking. Add everything to your plate and enjoy.</li>

        </ol>
